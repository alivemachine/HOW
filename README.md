## 📍 Overview

The project consists of two HTML webpages that utilize JavaScript to offer users interactive and visually appealing experiences. The first webpage allows users to submit either an image or text for analysis using the Maslo Companion API, updating the page with the analysis results and dynamic visual effects. The second webpage lets users manipulate a jellyfish-shaped pixel display by typing and generating unique visual effects based on their input, dynamically adjusting the pixel's properties. The project aims to provide engaging and interactive experiences while showcasing the capabilities of the Maslo Companion API and creative uses of JavaScript for visual effects.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase consists of HTML webpages with JavaScript functions that leverage the Maslo Companion API. It follows a client-side architecture, where the code makes HTTP POST requests to the API endpoints and updates the webpage dynamically. Key features include image/text analysis and applying visual effects based on the analysis results.  |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The repository lacks clear documentation. More information about the project's functionalities, design decisions, and usage guidelines would enhance its comprehensiveness and guidance for users.   |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on the Maslo Companion API for performing image/text analysis. Other external dependencies are not evident given the information provided.   |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | Based on the given file descriptions, the system appears to have a modular structure. The code is organized into separate files for different functionalities (how.html for analysis using the Maslo Companion API and how02.html for a pixel display). However, a closer examination of the codebase would be needed to ascertain the true level of modularity.   |
| **✔️ Testing**          | No information is available about testing strategies or tools used for this codebase. The existence and coverage of any tests remain unclear.   |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Judging performance solely based on the file descriptions is not possible. In terms of overall performance, the code may be subject to the efficiency and speed of the Maslo Companion API for analysis and user experience.   |
| **🔐 Security**        | Security measures are not mentioned specifically. Since the code interacts with an external API and potentially submits user data, ensuring proper handling and protection of sensitive data would be crucial.   |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase utilizes Git as the version control system, as indicated by the GitHub repository. However, specific practices, branching strategies, and release management are not provided.   |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase integrates with the Maslo Companion API for analysis functionality. Details about other integrations or interactions with external services are not mentioned.   |
| **📶 Scalability**     | Scalability considerations are not evident from the information provided. The architectural decisions and relevant design choices in the system may impact its scalability.   |

| [how.html](https://github.com/alivemachine/how/blob/main/how.html)     | The code is an HTML webpage with JavaScript functions that allow users to submit an image or text for analysis using the Maslo Companion API. The code makes POST requests to the API endpoints and updates the webpage with the analysis results. It also includes visual effects based on the analysis, changing the appearance of a div element dynamically. |
| [how02.html](https://github.com/alivemachine/how/blob/main/how02.html) | The code creates an interactive webpage where users can type and manipulate a jellyfish-shaped pixel display. Each character in the user's input generates a unique visual effect on the jellyfish using box shadows and colors. The code dynamically adjusts the pixel's position, color, and other properties based on user input.                            |
