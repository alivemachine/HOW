## 📍 Overview

The project consists of two HTML webpages that utilize JavaScript to offer users interactive and visually appealing experiences. The first webpage allows users to submit either an image or text for analysis using the Maslo Companion API, updating the page with the analysis results and dynamic visual effects. The second webpage lets users manipulate a jellyfish-shaped pixel display by typing and generating unique visual effects based on their input, dynamically adjusting the pixel's properties. The project aims to provide engaging and interactive experiences while showcasing the capabilities of the Maslo Companion API and creative uses of JavaScript for visual effects.

| [how.html](https://github.com/alivemachine/how/blob/main/how.html)     | The code is an HTML webpage with JavaScript functions that allow users to submit an image or text for analysis using the Maslo Companion API. The code makes POST requests to the API endpoints and updates the webpage with the analysis results. It also includes visual effects based on the analysis, changing the appearance of a div element dynamically. |
| [how02.html](https://github.com/alivemachine/how/blob/main/how02.html) | The code creates an interactive webpage where users can type and manipulate a jellyfish-shaped pixel display. Each character in the user's input generates a unique visual effect on the jellyfish using box shadows and colors. The code dynamically adjusts the pixel's position, color, and other properties based on user input.                            |
